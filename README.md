# Notebooks

This repository contains a series of Jupyter Notebooks I've worked on throughout my studies in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Data Science. Below is a comprehensive list:

* [Matrix Multiplication Implementation Using NumPy](https://github.com/csbanon/notebooks/blob/master/matrix-multiplication-implementation-using-numpy.ipynb)
* [Univariate Linear Regression with Batch Gradient Descent](https://github.com/csbanon/notebooks/blob/master/univariate-linear-regression-with-batch-gradient-descent.ipynb)
